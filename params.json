{"name":"EnumerableExtensions","tagline":"Extension methods for IEnumerable<T>.","body":"**EnumerableExtensions** is a C# library containing extensions for `IEnumerable<T>`. Some methods are new and some are simply more convenient overloads of existing methods. Most of them follow the spirit of LINQ, in that they often take delegates (like lambdas) and they use lazy evaluation where possible.\r\n\r\nThe library is written and maintained by [**Theodoros Chatzigiannakis**](https://github.com/TChatzigiannakis). It is distributed as free software, covered by the [**MPLv2**](https://github.com/TChatzigiannakis/enumerableextensions/blob/master/LICENSE).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
