This is a Portable Class Library written in C#. You can open it using some versions of Visual Studio (those that support this project type) or, alternatively, Xamarin Studio.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains the source code for a tiny portable library called EnumerableExtensions (also distributed as a NuGet package) and it exposes various extension methods for IEnumerable<T> that I felt I wanted to use often and were either missing or had a syntax that I didn't quite prefer.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just open it with an appropriate version of Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio and Build Solution!
* Keep in mind that the automated unit tests project is not a supported in Xamarin Studio (but you can still build the actual library). I'll try to provide alternative ways to test, for Xamarin Studio users.
